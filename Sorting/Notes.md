# Permutations
---

Was a simple observation of breaking the permutations into two parts an odd series and an even series?

# Two Knights


A knight can attack another Knight in 2 ways within a 2 across a 2x3 block(assuming the colors are same (indistinguishable knights)
)

# Two sets

Analyze special cases of modulo 4 lengths ! Break donw into cases of 4k , 4k+1, 4k + 2, 
4k + 3 works because 1 + 2 = 3 and the problem is reducible to 4k , try to look in temrs of reducing the problem to 4k!
try to make cases and reduce one case to the other!
